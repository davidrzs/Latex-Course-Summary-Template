# Latex Summary / Cheatsheet with Code Template

## What is it?
This is a GitHub repository hosting a simple and ready to use Latex template to write summaries or cheatsheets for STEM subjects. I have used it extensively and since other people might find it useful too I have uploaded it to GitHub.
The template is more or less just a combination of other open source projects, make sure you check them out in the [credits section](#credits) below.
